3D Quadcopter Model
This repository contains the 3D model files for a conceptual quadcopter design. It showcases the geometric and structural aspects of a multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

Overview
This project presents a 3D model of a quadcopter, designed to visualize its form factor and component arrangement. It serves as a representation of a basic multi-rotor drone structure.

Features
Quadcopter Design: A 3D representation of a four-rotor drone configuration.
Geometric Visualization: Provides a visual understanding of the drone's shape and key components like the main body and propellers.
Conceptual Model: This model explores a potential structural layout for a quadcopter.
